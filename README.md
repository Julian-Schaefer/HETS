## Introduction

In this project, we implemented a Home Energy Trading System that is able to forecast its energy demand
and then negotiate with different retailers to buy or sell energy. Main objective of the system is to
minimize the cost of energy for your home by using smart forecasts and energy usage predictions of the
home appliances to negotiate the best offers/prices with multiple retailers. This project is implemented
in Java using JADE and GUI using Java Swing framework.
